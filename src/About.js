        <h2>Hi! I'm Justus Witmer. Here's a little about myself.</h2>
        <p className='secondary'>
          I am a Full Stack Software Engineer student at Prime Digital Academy, with a background in analytics.
          I have experience in small business analytics as well as finance analytics. My interests lie mainly in using my skills as a software engineer to leverage data analysis to better inform a business on decision making.
          My personality is such that I am always pushing for new ways to look at data, yet I also have enough restraint to know when to slow down and complete a project.
